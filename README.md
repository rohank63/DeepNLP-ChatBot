# Building ChatBot using Deep NLP (Seq2Seq) model
This is an attempt at building a ChatBot using [Seq2Seq](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/seq2seq-model-in-machine-learning/) model. This model is based on 2 [LSTM] Layers. Seq2Seq mainly consists of 2 components i.e Encoder and Decoder, hence sometimes it is also called Encoder-Decoder network.
