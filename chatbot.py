### Phase 1: Data Preprocessing ###



# Importing the dataset
'''
Adding encoding = 'utf-8', errors = 'ignore' to open file commands below are to make sure that any files
such as dataset files, csv etc added to the program are encoded properly by which we mean that they are
set to a language that can be understood by the machine since we have various file formats
'''

# Creating a list of all of the conversations
'''
We use an indexing of [:-1] in conversations because -1 is the last row of
conversations and by taking : in [:-1], we take an index ranging from beginning
to the last row but since the upper bound is excluded, so, it will also exclude
the last row which is the empty row

To simplify conversations dataset, we used split() to remove brackets, spaces and quotes
for the purpose of which we introduced another temp variable _conversation
'''
conversations_ids = []

# Getting questions and answers seperately
'''
We will get questions(which are input) and answers(which are target) seperately
before clean up of questions and answers to simplify the dataset as much as possible

conversation[i] refers to the index of the first element, so index for answer
we want to append should be the next index, so, it will be [i+1]

### Phase 2: Building SEQ2SEQ Model ###



# Creating placeholders for the inputs and the targets
'''
The tf.placeholder accepts 3 parameters (type of data, dimensions of input data, name for input)

Dimensions of the input data must be 2 dimensional(in tf.placeholder) because neural networks
can only accept inputs that are in batches, as opposed to single input. Thus, we add 1 dimension
corresponding to the batch.

keep_prob is a hyperparameter used to control the dropout rate. Dropout rate is the rate of the
neurons you choose to overwrite during the one iteration of the training.
'''
def model_inputs():
    inputs = tf.placeholder(tf.int32, [None, None], name = 'input')
    targets = tf.placeholder(tf.int32, [None, None], name = 'target')
    lr = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, name = 'learning_rate')
    keep_prob = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, name = 'keep_prob')
    return inputs, targets, lr, keep_prob

# Preprocessing the targets
'''
We have to delete last column of answer dict before adding <SOS> to process target fuctions to
preserve the max sequence length since after that we do a concat to add <SOS> token at the
beginning of the sequence, thus, we must remove the last token befor so that the sequence
length doesn't go over the max sequence length

Need for preprocessing? -> Decoder only accepts a certain format of targets(targets must be in batches)
so preprocessing is necessary

# Explanation:
    right_side = tf.strided_slice(targets, [0,0], [batch_size, -1])
    : [0,0] > is the upper left side of tensor (from where you want to begin the extraction)
    : [batch_size, -1] > taking all the lines except the last column (end, up to where we want to make the extraction)
    : Last argument tells by how many cells we want to slice when doing the extraction and
    since we want to get all the lines except last column, we will use a slice of [1,1]
'''
def preprocess_targets(targets, word_to_int, batch_size):
    left_side = tf.fill([batch_size, 1], word_to_int['<SOS>'])
    right_side = tf.strided_slice(targets, [0,0], [batch_size, -1], [1,1])
    preprocessed_targets = tf.concat([left_side, right_side], 1)
    return preprocessed_targets

# Creating the Encoder RNN
'''
LSTM Dropout is a technique used for regularization in neural nets
and it helps in learning and preventing overfitting with the data.

Overfitting > happens when a model learns the detail and noise in the training data
to the extent that it negatively impacts the performance of the model on new data

Encoder_cell >  the cell inside the encoder RNN that contains the stacked LSTM layers on which
                 we apply dropout to improve accuracy
Encoder_state > output returned by the encoder RNN, right after the last fully connected layer

# Explanation:
    def encoder_rnn(rnn_inputs, rnn_size, num_layers, keep_prob, sequence_length)
    : rnn_inputs = corresponds to the model inputs
    : rnn_size = number of input tensors in encoder rnn layer
    : num_layers = number of layers
    : keep_prob = used to apply dropout to improve accuracy of model
    : sequence_length = length of list of each question in the batch

# Decoding the training set
'''
> We need the decode training set to decode the encoded questions and answers of the training set (the second part of the Seq2Seq model)

> This function thus, decodes the observations of the training set and also returns output of the decoder at the same time which
was for the observation of the training set that is some observation going bak in the neural network to update the weights
and thus, update the ability of the chatbot to talk like a human.

    : encoder_state = decoder gets encoder_state as input to to decoding
    : decoder_cell = cell in the RNN of the decoder. It contains stacked LSTM layers with dropout applied
    : decoder_embedded_input = embedding means mapping from discreet objects, such as words, to vectors of real numbers
    : sequence_length = length of list of each question in the batch

    : keep_prob = used to apply dropout to improve accuracy of model

The purpose of the embeddings matrix is to compute more efficiently the embedding input.
Basically, you multiply your vector of inputs by the embeddings matrix to get your embedded inputs.

'''
> Epochs : an epoch is a whole process of getting the batches of inputs into the neural network and then for propagating them inside the encoders
    to get the encoder state and for propagating the encoder states with the targets inside the decoder RNN to get the final output. First, final output scores
    then final answers predicted by chatbot and then back propagating the loss generated by the output and the target back into the Neural network and updating the weight
    of the better ability of the chatbot to work like a human. An epoch is basically one whole iteration of the training.
> Num_layers : number of layers you have in encoder and decoder RNN
> Encoding_embedding_size : it Is the number of columns in embeddings matrix that is the number of columns you want to have for
    embeddings value where in matrix each line corresponds to each token in the whole question of the corpus
> Learning_rate : it must be not be too high or too low. If it is too high the model will learn too fast and will not therefore not learn how to speak properly and
    if it is slow it will take a long for model to learn properly.
> Learning rate decay :  it means by what percentage the learning rate is reduced over the iterations of the training because we want to start with some learning rate
    but we want to apply decay over the iterations of the training to reduce the learning rate so it can learn more in depth the logic of human conversations and in our case,
    or general the correlations found in the dataset.
